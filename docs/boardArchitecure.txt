Chess board architecure

The board should just have squares
The square should know how to render iteself
The square should know how to dispaly a piece

State?
State should be an array of pieces?
The board has a view
The board view should just render
The board also has pieces
Pieces should render secondly
The board logic should just change the positioning of the pieces when given instructions

Board view
Board HTML
Each div should have a class with its location ID
Collection called board
collection called pieces
model called piece
model called square?


Im  NOT going to make a server, Instead I will save a json config with PGN games converted to FEN format
The setting will control the timing that Render is called


The board will take a FEN string of the next state and render the  board according to the string

React only cares about the render
Backbone cares about the storage as well

I will attempt this board in 2 diff ways

Nested array - Updating Raw values in array, render the board 

Nested objects - Creating the board via an array of pieces and having the board proccess the string
